Here I'll make the new Little-Lemon table reservation functionality. It's something I'm pretty scared to finish because it entails a lot of different things that I've learnt in my front-end developing journey.

Here are some of the things that I'll be using in this project:

- Version Control with Git,
  I'll be using Git and GitHub to document every important change that I make, so that I can showcase my version control skills.
- React & JSX,
  I'll be programming this app using React, creating custom hooks where needed, using advanced context methods, and more.
- Advanced HTML & CSS,
  I'll be creating forms, using client form validation for the table reservation.
- NPM & Node.js,
  I'll be using npm to install the original create-react-app npm pack that this app is based on. This pack works as a template.
- Complex form validation with Formix & Yup.
  I'll be working with complex form validation to see if selected values are valid for the purpose of my app.

  I'll also create complex figma designs for my project that include,

- A full wireframe of the functionality that I intend to implement into the Little Lemon fictional restaurant app.
- Complex designs & high-fidelity design.

I'll document my entire functionality-creating journey, and I hope it's of help!
